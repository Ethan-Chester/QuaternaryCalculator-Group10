# Quaternary Calculator
## Overview
Group 10's Quaternary Calculator was made using JDK 21. We used JUnit for testing and Swing for GUI elements.

By running the QuaternaryCalculatorGUI class, a calculator will appear on the screen. You use this as a normal calculator. There are buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, and finding the square root. Use the "=" to find the answer to the inputted equation. Use the "C" button to clear your calculations. Use the "toggle" button to view your quaternary digits in decimal form.

## Meetings

### 9/2/2024, 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm
Attendees: Jadi Miller, Ethan Chester, Mia Lacey, Cyarina Amatya

Medium: Remote, Google Meet

Discussion: Ethan began work on the logic of the calculator before the meeting began. He caught the three other members up on what he has implemented. After that, we split up responsibilities. Jadi and Cyarina will implement unit-tests. Ethan will complete the logic. Mia will complete the GUI. 

### 9/3/2924, 2:00 pm - 4:00 pm
Attendees: Jadi Miller, Cyarina Amatya

Medium: In-Person

Discussion: Jadi and Cyarina implemented the test class and created tests for functions squareRoot, power, and tenToFour. They researched how to test the main function and made plans for implementation later.

## README Requirements

This file shall have screenshots of the project and a small manual on how to use the calculator.
If there are additional dependencies needed, these should be explained in the readme file as well.
